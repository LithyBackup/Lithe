<h5 align="center"> LITHE isn't just another cryptocurrency, its a money that works.</h5>

Lithe aims to study the best practices of the fiat world and work towards developing products to be
user-friendly for the people. So even though people are using the Lithe crypto on the backend, they
will have no problems interacting with it because of its elegent UI. Lithe is built upon the
[TurtleCoin](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin) network which has features such as
[Light Blocks](https://blog.turtlecoin.lol/archives/the-quest-for-lightning-block-propagation/),
[Private Transactions](https://cryptonote.org/inside#unlinkable-transaction) and [Blockchain Analysis Resistance](https://cryptonote.org/inside#blockchain-analysis-resistance).
Lithe has a maximum supply of 25 billion coins allowing enough coins constantly
flowing within the network but not too many that you would have to use more coins than expected to
purchase goods.

We know of one minor problem between cryptocurrency and noenhich it allows anyone and everyone the
ability to benefit from it.
